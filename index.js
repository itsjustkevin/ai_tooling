  My goal is to create exciting, user-focused release notes for a quarterly update of the Flutter software development kit. Please analyze the provided commit history and focus on changes that directly impact how developers build apps with Flutter. Here's the format I'd like:

  **Format**

  * **Cool short feature name:** A catchy, informative title highlighting the key benefit.
  * **Description of the feature that is relevant to end users of the SDK and exciting:** A concise description explaining what the feature does and why developers should care. Keep it non-technical and focus on how it improves the app-building experience.

  **Instructions**

  1. **Prioritize Visibility:** Focus on updates that end users of apps built with Flutter are likely to notice (e.g., new UI elements, performance improvements, smoother animations).
  2. **Emphasize Benefits:** Explain how each change makes app development easier, faster, or unlocks new possibilities.
  3. **Be Creative:**  Use engaging language and try to frame the features in a way that generates excitement.
  4. **Condense:** Keep descriptions brief and to the point.
  5. **Limit Results:** Provide only the top 10 most impactful and exciting features in the specified format.

  **Commit History:**
  * **${notes}**
